Changes applied
1) Prediction ETA polling
- Added 10s polling loop in PredictionScreen to repeatedly fetch ETA (backend first, fallback to distance/speed) and update UI state.
- Resets alert arming when destination/stop changes.

2) Arrival alerts
- Alert now fires when ETA crosses from >60s to <=60s inside the polling loop.
- Uses NotificationStore so Notification screen shows the new alerts automatically.

3) Stop coordinates
- Merges route inu-a stop coordinates (when available) into fallback stop coord map for more accurate distance-based ETA.

Notes
- Build not run here due to gradle wrapper lock permission issue; please run `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` after fixing permissions.
